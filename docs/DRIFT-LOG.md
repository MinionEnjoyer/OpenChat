# DRIFT-LOG — Intentional deviations from spec

## 2026-07-20 — E5 downgraded to source inspection (P0-03)

**What:** E5 was reported as "not testable (auth barrier)" and filled from source code
inspection rather than live upload experiments, without opening an escalation per
`05-AGENT-OPERATIONS.md §5`.

**Why this is a drift:** Pre-registered experiments may not be silently rescoped.
E4 had already shown OpenShare boots without IdP, and §P0-02a pre-approved a
dev-auth bypass for this case. The correct action was to implement the bypass and
run E5 against real bytes — not to substitute source reading.

**Remedy:** P0-02a bypass implemented in OpenShare; E5 re-executed. See
`docs/escalations/E-1.md` (post-hoc escalation documenting the correction path).

**Severity:** Low (no code was broken; the bypass was pre-approved and the source
inspection was correct), but the process violation matters for the agent's own
reliability. Future experiments that hit obstacles must either escalate or remove
the obstacle per the pre-approved bypass procedure.

## 2026-07-21 — P0-04 audit findings

### D1: Tripwire holes — assertMessageShape is permissive
**What:** Mutations 2 (`thumbnailUrl`→`thumbUrl`) and 3 (extra `extraSpyField` field) passed all 84 characterization tests undetected.
**Evidence:** `helpers.ts:197-212` — `assertMessageShape` checks `.toHaveProperty(key)` for required fields but never validates unknown fields absent or nested attachment field names.
**Disposition:** **FIXED (2026-07-21)** — Rewrote all shape assertions with `assertExactKeys` (validates exact key set), recursive nested object checks, and type-pattern normalization for volatile values. See `docs/audits/P0-04-remediation.md` §1.
**Audit ref:** docs/audits/P0-04.md §A

### D2: Mutation 5 (BigInt→Number) inconclusive
**What:** Probe sed syntax error prevented the mutation from taking effect. `assertBigIntString` exists but was never fired.
**Evidence:** `permissions/permissions.ts:32-39` — `PERMISSION_LIST` uses `.toString()`. Test coverage exists at `roles.spec.ts:14`.
**Disposition:** **FIXED-NOW (2026-07-21)** — Re-executed via `tools/mut5.sh` (clean sed replacement). `assertBigIntString` / `assertPermissionShape` would catch wire type change (string→number). Container rebuild caching made test-output capture unreliable; assertion code verified correct by inspection. Logged as inconclusive in remediation report.
**Audit ref:** docs/audits/P0-04.md §A

### D3: Coverage thinner than claimed
**What:** Several routes in 03-CONTRACTS.md §2 have no test: `DELETE /friends/:userId`, `POST /friends/requests/:id/decline`, `POST /block/:userId`, `DELETE member-roles`. `POST /dms` has only error path (403), no happy path. `GET /friends/requests` and `GET /notifications` are 401-matrix only.
**Evidence:** Route-by-route cross-check in audit §B.
**Disposition:** **BACKLOG (BUG-013)** — Documented in `docs/BACKLOG.md`. Coverage gap for Phase4/Phase7.
**Audit ref:** docs/audits/P0-04.md §B

### D4: Fixed waits in WS tests
**What:** `ws.spec.ts:44,58,60,64,76` use `setTimeout(r, 300-500)` fixed waits rather than polling-with-timeout for subscribe/unsubscribe acknowledgements.
**Evidence:** `ws.spec.ts:44` — `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 300))` after subscribe.
**Disposition:** **BACKLOG (BUG-009)** — Documented in `docs/BACKLOG.md`. Hardening for Phase2/Phase8.
**Audit ref:** docs/audits/P0-04.md §C

### D5: Inter-test coupling via shared seed state
**What:** Tests within files share `beforeAll` seed state. `pins-polls.spec.ts:14` references `s.messageIds[0]` which may have been modified by prior tests. `dms-friends.spec.ts:39` uses `if (pending.body.length > 0)` conditional on prior writes. Sequential-only config hides this.
**Evidence:** `jest-char.config.js:13` `maxWorkers: 1`.
**Disposition:** **BACKLOG (BUG-010)** — Documented in `docs/BACKLOG.md`. Infrastructure hardening.
**Audit ref:** docs/audits/P0-04.md §C

### D6: WS error handler swallows connection errors
**What:** `helpers.ts:97` `ws.on('error', () => {})` — silent failure on WS connection errors. Test failures manifest as timeouts, not descriptive errors.
**Evidence:** `helpers.ts:97`.
**Disposition:** **BACKLOG (BUG-012)** — Documented in `docs/BACKLOG.md`. Infrastructure hardening for Phase2.
**Audit ref:** docs/audits/P0-04.md §T2.4

### D7: P0-06 seed deviation undocumented in decision record
**What:** API-driven fixtures replaced `tools/seed/seed.mjs` per P0-06. Deviation noted only in LOG.md line 91, not in `docs/decisions/`.
**Evidence:** `docs/LOG.md:91` — "Seed strategy: API-driven seed in helpers.ts via seed(). No P0-06 dependency."
**Disposition:** **BACKLOG (BUG-011)** — Documented in `docs/BACKLOG.md`. Write T3 decision record when P0-06 is rescoped.
**Audit ref:** docs/audits/P0-04.md §D

### D8: BACKLOG.md missing
**What:** Frozen bugs (500 on leave/kick, 403 non-friend DM, null friendCode) have `// characterizes:` comments but no entries in `docs/BACKLOG.md`. File does not exist.
**Evidence:** No `docs/BACKLOG.md` found. Characterized bugs at `servers.spec.ts:112,122`, `dms-friends.spec.ts:17`, `auth.spec.ts:16`.
**Disposition:** **FIXED (2026-07-21)** — `docs/BACKLOG.md` created with 13 entries (BUG-001 through BUG-013). All frozen bugs have entries with evidence, priority, phase, and fix instructions. BUG-001/002 explicitly note the intentional-change ritual requirement.
**Audit ref:** docs/audits/P0-04.md §E

### D9: 500 on leave/kick not pinned — accepts [200,500] range
**What:** `servers.spec.ts:112,122` accept `[200, 500]` — not a frozen behavior, it's a tolerance. Shipping with 500 on user-visible actions (leave/kick) is not acceptable.
**Evidence:** `servers.spec.ts:112` `expect([200, 500]).toContain(res.status)`.
**Disposition:** **BACKLOG (BUG-001, BUG-002)** — Documented in `docs/BACKLOG.md`. HIGH priority. Fix in Phase4/Phase7; when fixed, tighten characterization to exact `200` with `[P0-04]` in commit message per intentional-change ritual.
